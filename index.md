# What is Tahrovin Grit ?
Tahrovin Grit is a fork of Tahrovin, a NSFW Skyrim VR modlist. It retains some of the eye-candy its predecessor is known for, but opts for more grounded outfits and slightly less intrusive NSFW mods. It also features light survival gameplay and aims towards a slower-paced character growth, reworking many gameplay mechanics to provide a well-balanced challenge throughout your playthrough.

# Before You Start
Before you dive in, there's a couple things you need to be sure of first:

## Hardware Requirements
The following specs are recommended at minimum:
  * CPU: Intel 7th gen *OR* AMD Ryzen 3000 series 
  * RAM: 16GB of DDR4
  * GPU: RTX 2060 *or the AMD equivalent with at least 6GB of VRAM*

You will need at least `205GB` of disk space on an SSD for the installation. For the downloads, you will need an extra `86GB`- ideally you want *at least* `330GB` for temporary Wabbajack work space. It doesn't have to be an NVMe SSD, but a HDD of any kind will make the list painfully unplayable. 

**If you are struggling with performance, try the [performance tips here](docs/Performance Tips.html)**

## Accounts
In terms of accounts you will need:
  * Nexus Premium Account
  * LoversLab Account

Whilst you don't *need* a Nexus premium account to install the modlist, you'll have a considerably better time of it if you do.
