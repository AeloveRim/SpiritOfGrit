# What is Spirit of Grit ?
Spirit of Grit is a "hardcore-lite" modlist, providing increased challenge without going too far into tediousness. Gold is precious, character progression is slower, specialization is vital and magic is not a given. Many mod-added gameplay mechanics have been worked into character progression and can be unlocked through skills and custom perks.

As a SFW fork of Tahrovin Grit, the modlist also overhauls visuals and includes a lot of new quests, all of them fully tested and patched, bringing many hours of new content."

# Before You Start
Before you dive in, there's a couple things you need to be sure of first:

## Hardware Requirements
The following specs are recommended at minimum:
  * CPU: Intel 7th gen *OR* AMD Ryzen 3000 series 
  * RAM: 16GB of DDR4
  * GPU: RTX 2060 *or the AMD equivalent with at least 6GB of VRAM*

You will need at least `205GB` of disk space on an SSD for the installation. For the downloads, you will need an extra `86GB`- ideally you want *at least* `330GB` for temporary Wabbajack work space. It doesn't have to be an NVMe SSD, but a HDD of any kind will make the list painfully unplayable. 

**If you are struggling with performance, try the [performance tips here](docs/Performance Tips.html)**

## Accounts
In terms of accounts you will need:
  * Nexus Premium Account
  * LoversLab Account

Whilst you don't *need* a Nexus premium account to install the modlist, you'll have a considerably better time of it if you do.
