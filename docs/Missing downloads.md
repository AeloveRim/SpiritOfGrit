# Commonly Missing Downloads

The latest versions of wabbajack have trouble downloading mods from Loverslab. If you're getting messages about missing downloads after the installation ends, that's probably why. If so, you should download the following mods into your wabbajack download folder before starting the installer : 

[Hel Rising](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/18745-hel-rising-norse-dungeon-quest-and-follower-mod-se/)

[Maelstrom](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/18500-maelstrom-norse-dungeon-quest-mod-se/)

These are not NSFW mods but they are only available on LL and they're pretty good so I'm not getting rid of them.

And a last reminder : If your download folder is nested inside your modlist installation folder, as wabbajack does by default, it will be erased every time you reinstall and *you will lose all downloaded archives*, including those you may have downloaded manually.
